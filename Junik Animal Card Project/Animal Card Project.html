                <p>The 'Pittie", "Pibble", or "stocky boi" as they are informally referred to tend to have high social/attention needs. This brings out their fun loving side which is closely followed by their gentle and patient nature. Their natural love for people do not make them the best of guard dogs, although their desire to be lapdogs knows no bounds. </p>
